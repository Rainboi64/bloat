      <h1>Rainboi's wholesome bloating corner!</h1>
  </Header>  
  <main>
      <p>This is Rainboi's debloated den, it's a personal website inspired by Luke Smith's landchad.net's tutorial, the difference is this is a poorman's edition since it uses the godly power of github's supreme pages hosting ability.</p>
      <p>I am a 16yo script kiddy, I code primarially in C#, C++, Typescript. using Arch + KDE Plasma with Krohnkite for tiling support. I also use Alacritty for terminal emulation, and zsh as my default shell, for my code editor I use a heavly modded neovim, with neovide as a gui. I also use lf for my terminal file browsing and dolphin for the gui side.<p>
      <p>I really like graphics programming and I have a decent experince working on multiple projects in the field and in multiple APIs such as OpenGL, and DirectX. Some of these projects you can find on my github page like Fluint, which is a really neat, modular, fast, and minimalist level design utility. I also code other stuff for fun like some stupid niche game engines or such.</p>
      <h2>ongoing projects</h2>
      <p>these are some of the projects I am doing in my ever depressing procrastination full life, most of these are not very **official so I am not pouring much time or effort into them simply because I am too lazy to, also I like to belive that I have other important things to do so don't bother me.</p>
